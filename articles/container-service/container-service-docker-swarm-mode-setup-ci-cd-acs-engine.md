# Full CI/CD pipeline to deploy a multi-container application on Azure Container Service with ACS Engine and Docker Swarm Mode using Visual Studio Team Services

*Based on 
[Full CI/CD pipeline to deploy a multi-container application on Azure Container Service with Docker Swarm using Visual Studio Team Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/container-service/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd.md) documentation*

One of the biggest challenges when developing modern applications for the cloud is being able to deliver these applications continuously. In this article, you learn how to implement a full continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using: 
* Azure Container Service Engine with Docker Swarm Mode
* Azure Container Registry
* Visual Studio Team Services

This article is based on a simple application, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/diegomrtnzg/MyShop/tree/docker-linux), developed with ASP.NET Core. The application is composed of four different services: three web APIs and one web front end:

![MyShop sample application](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/myshop-application.png)

The objective is to deliver this application continuously in a Docker Swarm Mode cluster, using Visual Studio Team Services. The following figure details this continuous delivery pipeline:

![MyShop sample application](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/full-ci-cd-pipeline.png)

Here is a brief explanation of the steps:

1. Code changes are committed to the source code repository (here, GitHub) 
2. GitHub triggers a build in Visual Studio Team Services 
3. Visual Studio Team Services gets the latest version of the sources and builds all the images that compose the application 
4. Visual Studio Team Services pushes each image to a Docker registry created using the Azure Container Registry service 
5. Visual Studio Team Services triggers a new release 
6. The release runs some commands using SSH on the Azure container service cluster master node 
7. Docker Swarm Mode on the cluster pulls the latest version of the images 
8. The new version of the application is deployed using Docker Stack 

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you need to complete the following tasks:

- [Create a Swarm Mode cluster in Azure Container Service wit ACS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-acsengine-swarmmode)
- [Connect with the Swarm cluster in Azure Container Service](container-service-connect.md)
- [Create an Azure container registry](../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal.md)
- [Have a Visual Studio Team Services account and team project created](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services)
- [Fork the GitHub repository to your GitHub account](https://github.com/diegomrtnzg/MyShop/tree/docker-linux)

> Note: the Docker Swarm orchestrator in Azure Container Service uses legacy standalone Swarm. Currently, the integrated [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) (in Docker 1.12 and higher) is not a supported orchestrator in Azure Container Service. For this reason, we are using [ACS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/swarmmode.md), a community-contributed [quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-acsengine-swarmmode/), or a Docker solution in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).

## Step 1: Configure your Visual Studio Team Services account 

In this section, you configure your Visual Studio Team Services account.

### Install the Docker Integration VSTS extension

Microsoft provides a VSTS extension to work with Docker in build and release processes. This extension is available in the [VSTS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.docker). Click **Install** to add this extension to your VSTS account:

![Install the Docker Integration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/install-docker-vsts.png)

You are asked to connect to your VSTS account using your credentials. 

### Connect Visual Studio Team Services and GitHub

Set up a connection between your VSTS project and your GitHub account.

1. In your Visual Studio Team Services project, click the **Settings** icon in the toolbar, and select **Services**.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - External Connection](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/vsts-services-menu.png)

2. On the left, click **New Service Endpoint** > **GitHub**.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - GitHub](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/vsts-github.png)

3. To authorize VSTS to work with your GitHub account, click **Authorize** and follow the procedure in the window that opens.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Authorize GitHub](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/vsts-github-authorize.png)

### Connect VSTS to your Azure container registry and Azure Container Service cluster

The last steps before getting into the CI/CD pipeline are to configure external connections to your container registry and your Docker Swarm cluster in Azure. 

1. In the **Services** settings of your Visual Studio Team Services project, add a service endpoint of type **Docker Registry**. 

2. In the popup that opens, enter the URL and the credentials of your Azure container registry.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Docker Registry](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/vsts-registry.png)

3. For the Docker Swarm cluster, add an endpoint of type **SSH**. Then enter the SSH connection information of your Swarm cluster.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - SSH](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-setup-ci-cd/vsts-ssh.png)

All the configuration is done now. In the next steps, you create the CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys the application to the Docker Swarm cluster. 

## Step 2: Create the build definition

In this step, you set up a build definition for your VSTS project and define the build workflow for your container images

### Initial definition setup

1. To create a build definition, connect to your Visual Studio Team Services project and click **Build & Release**. In the **Build definitions** section, click **+ New**. 

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - New Build Definition](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/create-build-vsts.PNG)

2. Select the **Empty process**.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - New Empty Build Definition](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/create-empty-build-vsts.PNG)

3. Configure the new build with a GitHub repository source, check **Continuous integration**, and select the agent queue where you registered your Linux agent. Click **Create** to create the build definition.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Create Build Definition](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-create-build-github.PNG)

4. On the **Build Definitions** page, open the **Triggers** tab and configure the build to use continuous integration with the fork of the MyShop project that you created in the prerequisites. Then, select **Batch changes**. Make sure that you select *docker-linux* as the **Branch specification**.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Build Repository Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-github-repo-conf.PNG)

5. Then, click the **Variables** tab and create two new variables: **RegistryURL** and **AgentURL**. Paste the values of your Registry and Cluster Agents DNS.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Build Repository Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-variables.png)

### Define the build workflow
The next steps define the build workflow. There are five container images to build for the *MyShop* application. Each image is built using the Dockerfile located in the project folders:

* ProductsApi
* Proxy
* RatingsApi
* RecommandationsApi
* ShopFront

You need two Docker steps for each image, one to build the image, and one to push the image in the Azure container registry. 

1. To add a step in the build workflow, click **+ Add build step** and select **Docker**.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Add Build Steps](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-add-task.png)

2. For each image, configure one step that uses the `docker build` command.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Docker Build](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-docker-build.png)

    For the build operation, select your Azure container registry, the **Build an image** action, and the Dockerfile that defines each image. Set the **Build context** as the Dockerfile root directory, define the **Image Name**, and select **Include Latest Tag**.
    
    As shown on the preceding screen, start the image name with the URI of your Azure container registry. (You can also use a build variable to parameterize the tag of the image, such as the build identifier in this example.)

3. For each image, configure a second step that uses the `docker push` command.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Docker Push](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-docker-push.png)

    For the push operation, select your Azure container registry, the **Push an image** action, enter the **Image Name** that is built in the previous step and select **Include Latest Tag**.

4. After you configure the build and push steps for each of the five images, add three more steps in the build workflow.

    a. A command-line task that uses a bash script to replace the *RegistryURL* occurrence in the docker-compose.yml file with the RegistryURL variable. 
    
    ```-c "sed -i 's/RegistryUrl/$(RegistryURL)/g' src/docker-compose.yml"```

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Update Compose file with Registry URL](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-replace-registry.png)

    b. A command-line task that uses a bash script to replace the *AgentURL* occurrence in the docker-compose.yml file with the AgentURL variable.
    
    ```-c "sed -i 's/AgentUrl/$(AgentURL)/g' src/docker-compose.yml"```

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Update Compose file with Agent URL](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-build-replace-agent.png)

    c. A task that drops the updated Compose file as a build artifact so it can be used in the release. See the following screen for details.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Publish Compose file](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-publish-compose.png) 

5. Click **Save** and name your build definition.

## Step 3: Create the release definition

Visual Studio Team Services allows you to [manage releases across environments](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/release-management/). You can enable continuous deployment to make sure that your application is deployed on your different environments (such as dev, test, pre-production, and production) in a smooth way. You can create an environment that represents your Azure Container Service Docker Swarm Mode cluster.

![Visual Studio Team Services - Release to ACS](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-acs.png) 

### Initial release setup

1. To create a release definition, click **Releases** > **+ Release**

2. To configure the artifact source, Click **Artifacts** > **Link an artifact source**. Here, link this new release definition to the build that you defined in the previous step. After that, the docker-compose.yml file is available in the release process.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Release Artifacts](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-artefacts.png) 

3. To configure the release trigger, click **Triggers** and select **Continuous Deployment**. Set the trigger on the same artifact source. This setting ensures that a new release starts when the build completes successfully.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Release Triggers](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-trigger.png) 

4. To configure the release variables, click **Variables** and select **+Variable** to create three new variables with the info of the registry: **docker.username**, **docker.password**, and **docker.registry**. Paste the values of your Registry and Cluster Agents DNS.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Build Repository Configuration](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-variables.png)

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > As shown on the previous screen, click the **Lock** checkbox in docker.password. This setting is important to restrict the password.
    >

### Define the release workflow

The release workflow is composed of two tasks that you add.

1. Configure a task to securely copy the compose file to a *deploy* folder on the Docker Swarm master node, using the SSH connection you configured previously. See the following screen for details.

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Release SCP](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-scp.png)

2. Configure a second task to execute a bash command to run `docker` and `docker stack deploy` commands on the master node. See the following screen for details.

    ```docker login -u $(docker.username) -p $(docker.password) $(docker.registry) && export DOCKER_HOST=:2375 && cd deploy && docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml myshop --with-registry-auth```

    ![Visual Studio Team Services - Release Bash](./media/container-service-docker-swarm-mode-setup-ci-cd-acs-engine/vsts-release-bash.png)

    The command executed on the master uses the Docker CLI and the Docker-Compose CLI to do the following tasks:

    - Log in to the Azure container registry (it uses three build variables that are defined in the **Variables** tab)
    - Define the **DOCKER_HOST** variable to work with the Swarm endpoint (:2375)
    - Navigate to the *deploy* folder that was created by the preceding secure copy task and that contains the docker-compose.yml file 
    - Execute `docker stack deploy` commands that pull the new images and create the containers.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > As shown on the previous screen, leave the **Fail on STDERR** checkbox unchecked. This setting allows us to complete the release process due to `docker-compose` prints several diagnostic messages, such as containers are stopping or being deleted, on the standard error output. If you check the checkbox, Visual Studio Team Services reports that errors occurred during the release, even if all goes well.
    >
3. Save this new release definition.

## Step 4. Test the CI/CD pipeline

Now that you are done with the configuration, it's time to test this new CI/CD pipeline. The easiest way to test it is to update the source code and commit the changes into your GitHub repository. A few seconds after you push the code, you will see a new build running in Visual Studio Team Services. Once completed successfully, a new release is triggered and deployed the new version of the application on the Azure Container Service cluster.
